### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Haris Hasan, a Data Science and Applied Statistics dual major at Purdue, and am highly interested in the use of ML to solve real world problems (business or otherwise).

I've put some of my more interesting work up here. You'll always find my most recent updates on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harishasan001/). Reach out to harishasan001@gmail.com for conversation about what I'm working on behind the scenes!
